### Words can cross dimensions
This project is under very active development. We are doing everything we can, as fast we can & as best as possible, to deliver a powerful software. We've released a very early alpha (I know you won't call it that) as a public open source project. This is about books, folks. It can't be close.

You can download the Windows (.exe) & Linux (.deb) and try it out <a href="https://matikbird.github.io/textile/">here</a>.

# Wanna contribute?
We are doing this for free, just for the sake of making something different about books.
We don't want to spoil anything, don't we? 
Pay attention.

To package the app for Windows, Linux & Mac, do this:
```

# Multilanguage
Textile supports **English** and **Spanish** by default.
We are seeking for help to anyone who wanna help us translating just a few lines.

# Math
Yes, we do like science. Mostly the science which requires a lot of math. Oh boy, what's out there it's mindblowing, and we have the pattern thanks to maths.
Textile supports LaTeX, you can write the mathmatical expression in realtime ([I uploaded a repo about this](https://github.com/matikbird/mathjax-atom-directive) and [these guys (mathjax-electron)](https://github.com/nteract/mathjax-electron/) and MathJax had helped me a lot to achieve this).

# Export
Currently, Textile can deploy your articles or complete tree of your project into:
- PDF
- EPUB
- TXT
- HTML
- DOCX
- EPUB3

# Sync
Even though our Android & iOS app's are not yet ready, we're working hard so you can see it yourself.<br>
Database NoSQL [PouchDB](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb) & [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/).

# Privacy
