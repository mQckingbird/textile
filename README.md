### Words can cross dimensions

This project is under very active development. We are doing everything we can, as fast we can & as best as possible, to deliver a powerful software. We've released a very early alpha (I know you won't call it that) as a public open source project. This is about books, folks. It can't be close.

You can download the Windows (.exe) & Linux (.deb) and try it out <a href="https://matikbird.github.io/textile/">here</a>.

# Wanna contribute?
We are doing this for free, just for the sake of making something different about books.
We don't want to spoil anything, don't we? 
Pay attention.

# Multilanguage
Textile supports **English** and **Spanish** by default.
We are seeking for help to anyone who wanna help us translating just a few lines.

# Math
Yes, we do like science. Mostly the science which requires a lot of math. Oh boy, what's out there it's mindblowing, and we have the pattern thanks to maths.
Textile supports LaTeX, you can write the mathmatical expression in realtime ([I wrote a little plugin in a new repository](https://github.com/matikbird/mathjax-atom-directive).
