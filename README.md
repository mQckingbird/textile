Textile
==============
Write your thoughts across time. 
# Quick start
The only development dependency of this project is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). So just make sure you have it installed.
Then type few commands known to every Node developer...
```
git clone https://github.com/matikbird/textiled.git
cd textiled
npm install
npm start
```
... and that's it. You have it running.
In case it didn't work, do this:
```
cd app
npm install
npm start
```
# Who the fuck did this?
Well, my name is Mat√≠as and I just wanted to start with a solid base, and adventure into the wild deep water.
Wanna join and contribute? This software is far, very far from being mine. I really see it bigger than me.
I could use some help (:)
