### Words can cross dimensions
This project is under very active development. We are doing everything we can, as fast we can & as best as possible, to deliver a powerful software. We've released a very early alpha (I know you won't call it that) as a public open source project. This is about books, folks. It can't be close.

You can download the Windows (.exe) & Linux (.deb) and try it out.

# Wanna contribute?
We are doing this for free, just for the sake of making something really cool out of nowhere.
### Develop Textile yourself


# Who the fuck did this?
Well, my name is Mat√≠as and I just wanted to start with a solid base, and adventure into the wild deep water.
Wanna join and contribute? This software is far, very far from being mine. I really see it bigger than me.
I could use some help (:)
