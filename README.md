### Words can cross dimensions
This project is under very active development. We are doing everything we can, as fast we can & as best as possible, to deliver a powerful software. We've released a very early alpha (I know you won't call it that) as a public open source project. This is about books, folks. It can't be close.

You can download the Windows (.exe) & Linux (.deb) and try it out <a href="https://matikbird.github.io/textiled/">here</a>.

# Wanna contribute?
We are doing this for free, just for the sake of making something really cool out of nowhere.

#### Develop Textile yourself
```
$ git clone https://github.com/matikbird/textiled
$ cd textiled
$ npm install
```

Introduce those commands in your CLI and you good to go. If it didn't work (it's not likely), just do this as well:
```
$ cd app
$ npm install
```
#### Run app
```
$ npm start
```
#### Build app binaries
To package the app for Windows, Linux & Mac, do this:
```
$ npm run release
```
To select the platform
```
$ npm run release -- «platform»
```
