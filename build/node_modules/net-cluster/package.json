However, in a cluster, each worker will receive the same \"random\" port each time they do listen(0). In essence, the port is random the first time, but predictable thereafter. If you want to listen on a unique port, generate a port number based on the cluster worker ID.\n\n### 2 problems with this functionality\n* listen(0) should always bind to a random port\n* the listen(cluster.workerId) is unreliable\n  - *you can't gurantee that the port cluster.workerId is available*\n\n***\n\n### how net-cluster operates\nlisten(0) always binds to a random port\n\n### usage\nnet-cluster strictly implements node's net module.\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * uses net-cluster instead of net to create a server\n * \n * Note: 2 servers will be created and they will be listening\n * on 2 distinct random ports. Try using node's net module instead\n * of net-cluster and see what happens.\n */\nvar cluster = require('cluster')\n  , net = require('net-cluster')\n  ;\n  \nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  cluster.fork();\n  cluster.fork();\n} else if (cluster.isWorker) {\n  var server = net.createServer();\n  server.listen(function() {\n    var port = server.address().port;\n    console.log('listening on port: ' + port);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n## use cases\n* network application that needs to open multiple non-pre-determined ports\n* if you provide a module that listens on port 0\n  - **this is a difficult bug for people using your module**. Not \n    only will every instance of your module code be sharing the same \n    socket, but **ANY** other piece of code using listen(0) will be\n    sharing the same socket (other modules or even the user's code)\n\n## The MIT License\n\nCopyright (c)\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
